== Glossary

In this section we will present, define and translate some concepts that we consider relevant to know when facing our application.

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use when discussing the system.

You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in multi-language teams.

.Motivation
You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

* have an identical understanding of these terms
* do not use synonyms and homonyms


.Form

A table with columns <Term> and <Definition>.

Potentially more columns in case you need translations.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-12/[Glossary] in the arc42 documentation.

|Acronym |Term |Definition

|ADR
|Arquitectural Design Record
|Document that describes a choice the team makes about a significant aspect of the software architecture they're planning to build. Each ADR describes the architectural decision, its context, and its consequences, and its goal is to ensure that the proposed design meets functional, aesthetic, regulatory, and safety requirements before proceeding further with the project.

|API
|Application Programming Interface
|Set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that developers can use to request and exchange information between different software components.

|CI/CD
|Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery
|CI refers to the practice of automatically and frequently integrating code changes into a shared source code repository; CD is a 2 part process that refers to the integration, testing, and delivery of code changes. Continuous delivery stops short of automatic production deployment, while continuous deployment automatically releases the updates into the production environment.
