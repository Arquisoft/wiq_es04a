== Cross-cutting Concepts

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

Some important concepts need to be taken into account so as to a better understanding of the application. These concepts have to do with the following categories.

. Domain concepts
. Architecture and Design Patterns
. User Experience (UX)
. Development Concepts
. Under-the-hood
. Operation Concepts


Next, each category will be detailed.

=== Domain concepts
TBD

=== Architecture and Design Patterns
* https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_es04a/#_12_3_technical_terms[**Microservice**]: In this application there are some microservices such as the User Management, which involves signing up, logging in and everything related to the points and timing of the user.

=== User Experience (UX)
* https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_es04a/#_12_3_technical_terms[**Frontend**]: the frontend of this application consists of a web app which will be deployed.
* https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_es04a/#_12_3_technical_terms[**Internationalization**] the application will be available in different languages, including English as the main language.

=== Security
TBD

=== Development Concepts
* **Testing**: Numerous use-cases will be studied so as to provide a solid and easy-to-use application.
* **CI/CD**: The application will be in continuous integration and deployment.

=== Under-the-hood
* **Persistency**: TBD
* **Session handing**: TBD
* **Business rules**: TBD

=== Operation Concepts
* **Administration**: TBD
* **Logging**: TBD
* **Usability**: The application should be easy to use. Some testing is done to make sure that we achieve this objective
