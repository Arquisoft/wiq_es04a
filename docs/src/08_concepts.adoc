== Cross-cutting Concepts

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

Some important concepts need to be taken into account so as to a better understanding of the application. These concepts have to do with the following categories.

. Domain concepts
. User Experience (UX)
. Operation Concepts
. Architecture and Design Patterns
. Development Concepts

Next, each category will be detailed.

=== Domain concepts
At the moment, the application follows this schema:

* **User**: it is the person that uses the application. There can be multiple Users at the same time using the app. 
* **Contest**: The contest is the part that the User can see. It contains everything the user can do, such as play games o look for rankings and statistics.
* **Game**: The User can play different games, including _The Challenge_, _Wise Men Stack_ or even a multiplayer mode, which enables various Users to play together. Games consist of several questions to which users have to answer. Down below there is an schema that show the different game modes that will we available.
* **Question**: Each question has different answers but only one of them is correct. Answering correctly to the questions rewards users with _money_.
* **Statistics**: Each user has statistics that show different aspects of their profile, such as the time they invested on each game mode, correct and incorrect questions, etc.
* **Profile**: User's profile has data such as their username and the amount on _money_ they have earned.
* **Group**: Users are able to join or create groups, that way the can get to a groups ranking.

=== User Experience (UX)
* https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_es04a/#_technical_terms[**Frontend**]: the frontend of this application consists of a deployed web app which will be deployed. The user can register and log in with accounts already created on an intuitive page. They can also play different game modes and to consult their historial record, statistics, and even a ranking.
As it can be seen down below, the homepage is bright and appealing, which leads to a better user experience. Users can easily choose the game mode they prefer and play.

* https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_es04a/#_technical_terms[**Internationalization**] The application will likely be available in various languages, including English as the main language. This would provide a better user experience as users could better tailor the application to their personal preferences.

=== Operation Concepts
* **Usability**: The application should be easy to use. For this reason, we had some people try our application. This way we can know its strengths and weaknesses and improve them. Usability affects User Experience as well, so it is an important aspect of the application. Up to this moment, usability testing has helped with the color palette chosen the application.

=== Security
At the moment, security mechanisms are not the main focus of the application, but some decisions have already been made and will be implemented soon.

=== Architecture and Design Patterns
* https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_es04a/#_technical_terms[**Microservice**]: In this application there are some microservices such as the User Management, which involves signing up, logging in and everything related to the points and timing of the user. Microservices provide an easy way of creating a complex application composed by independent systems.
Another important microservice is the questions generation system. It creates infinite questions related to varios topics. Thats to this, users can never get bored of the game, as questions do not repeat themselves.
The webapp microservice includes everything related to the graphic interface. Users are able to communicate with the application thats to this service.


=== Development Concepts
* **Testing**: Numerous use-cases are studied so as to provide a solid and easy-to-use application. There are unitary tests related to every functionality of the project, as well as e2e tests regarding the main game.
* https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_es04a/#_acronyms[**CI/CD**]: The application is in continuous integration and deployment. Team members commit frequently into the repository where the project is stored. This makes it easier when assembling project parts involving collaboration from different team members.
