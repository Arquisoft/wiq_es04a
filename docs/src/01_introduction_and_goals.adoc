== Introduction and Goals (wiq_es04a)

The aim of this project is to create a version of the famous quiz show "Saber y Ganar". In the quiz you have to 
answer different questions about various topics (chosing topic will be possible), winning a reward for each correct answer. 
One of the most relevant requirement is that the questions are generated from WikiData so there will always be different questions.

To do the game we are going to develop a web application that will be available to enter from any device with internet connection.

Regarding quality requirements, the goal is to achieve an optimal level, especially in terms of usability,
 maintainability, efficiency, security, and testability.

The main stakeholders in the project are several. Firstly, Professor José Emilio Labra, who teaches the 
subject. Also, the students and members of the HappySoftware development team. Lastly, potential users of 
the application will show interest in the project, as their user experience depends on it.

Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****

=== Requirements Overview

An enumeration of the requirements that the project must meet in terms of functionality can be elaborated:

The application must be accessed through a web frontend.
A record of users and their game history will be maintained.
Both questions and answers will be generated using data collected from Wikidata, with only one of the 
four answer options being correct.
There will be a countdown to answer each question.
Two APIs will exist to access information about both users and generated questions.

.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Goals

|===
|Quality goal|Concrete scenario
|Usability|It must be easy to use the app, thus everybody could use it
|Availability|The system should be available the most time possible
|Security|The user's data must remain confidential.
|Performance|Using the system must be as smooth as possible. Especially, the question generation must be fast.

.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

|===
|Role/Name|Contact|Expectations
| Happy Software | Méndez Fernández, Hugo Barrero Cruz, Pablo Lago Conde, Alberto García-Ovies Pérez, Pablo Bustamante Larriet, Samuel González García, María Teresa Andina Pailos, Daniel | Students are the developers of the app. They need to do a great project to obtain a good mark.
| Teachers | José Emilio Labra | They will qualify the proyect.
| Users | Users of the game | They want to have fun answering questions. It must be intuitive and easy to use.

.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
