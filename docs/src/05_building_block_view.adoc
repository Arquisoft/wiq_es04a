== Building Block View
The building block view shows in a graphic way a decomposition of the system. 

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image::05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/[Building Block View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Whitebox Overall System

Main view of the system. WIQ application is related to one external component: the Wikidata API

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

Motivation::

This is a general overview of the application. Here it can be seen the external services that will be used.

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe black boxes
according the the following black box template:

* Purpose/Responsibility
* Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs. This interfaces may include qualities and performance characteristics.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box, e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....
* (Optional) directory/file location
* (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to requirements).
* (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

****

Contained Building Blocks::
* **Wikidata Infinite Quest**: It is the main application, represented as a blackbox that will be detailed in the following decompositions. 
* **Wikidata API**: It is the external API that the system uses to generate questions and answers.

=== Level 1

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from Overall System as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system
****

==== White Box WIQ

[role="arc42help"]
****
...describes the internal structure of _building block WIQ_.
****

image:05_level1.png["Diagram 05.2: Level1"]

Motivation::

First decomposition of the system. It shows the webapp, users managament and question generator modules as blackboxes. Also displays the docs module which contains the documentation of the project.

Contained Building Blocks::
* **Web App**: It is the main module of the application. 
* **User Management**: Handles user management.
* **Question Generation Service**: It is responsible for the automatic generation of questions and answers using the Wikidata API.

=== Level 2

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
part of arc42 for additional levels.
****
==== White Box Users Management

[role="arc42help"]
****
Specifies the internal structure of _building block Users Management_.
****

image:05_level2.png["Diagram 05.2: Level2"]

Motivation::

Decomposition of the level 1 system. It shows the gateway, users, authentification and database modules as blackboxes.

Contained Building Blocks::
* **Gateway Service**: Express service that is exposed to the public and serves as a proxy to the two next ones.
* **Authentication Service**: Express service that handles the authentication of users.
* **User Service**: Express service that handles the insertion of new users in the system.
* **Data Base**: MongoDB.

**PENDING TO COMPLETE...**
