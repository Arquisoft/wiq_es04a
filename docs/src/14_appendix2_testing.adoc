== Appendix II: Other tests

=== Unitary tests
We did unitary tests through the whole application. These tests were useful when getting to know if what we had just implemented worked properly or not. It is also a very esasy way of checking if you changed something without noticing. For example, if anything were modified, unitary tests where adapted to this new functionality. However, the changes made in the application may affect some parts that we were not expecting to be affected. This way we could be able to garantee that the application continued to work properly and to check if there were some parts that depended on others when they should not. For these reasons, it is very important to have as much as possible of our code covered. We have achieved a coverage percentage greater than 80%.

==== SonarCloud
The picture below shows an overview done with SonarCloud to our repository. As it can be seen, all of the diferent services reach 80% or more, some of them reaaching almost 90%. The total coverage of our project is around 82%. However, it is important to remember that coverage is not only about numbers but about testing projects in a good way.

We would also like to mention that SonarCloud offers a graphic where risks in different part of the code are displayed. Bubbles in the top right side of the graphic means that the longer-term health may be at risk. Green bubbles at the bottom-left are best. Down below there is the graphic of our project, which shows all bubbles in green and most of them are in the left-bottom part.

=== Acceptance tests
Acceptance tests are also important. They do not focus on the functionality of the application but on the user experience. This way we were able to know easily if elements where rendered quickly. In addition, this tests let us measure how long it takes for an interaction with the application. 
For this tests we used a MariaDB database created only for these tests. We useb MariaDB because we need to get information from users, which are https://github.com/Arquisoft/wiq_es04a/wiki/ADR-04-‚Äê-Users-and-Groups-with-MariaDB[ stored in this type of relational database.]

We focused in testing the different games available, as it is the core part of the application. It is important to mention that e2e tests can be executed two ways. The first way, using a graphic interface, which easier for the developer. We are able to see how the tests are executing so we may see some issues that otherwise we would not be able to detect.
The second way is without graphic interface. It is done this way when e2e tests are executed through Github actions in deployment, not locally. It is sometimes more difficult to detect the issues but there is still a great overview of the tests execution which helps to detect problems.
