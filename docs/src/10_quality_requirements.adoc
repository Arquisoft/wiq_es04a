== Quality Requirements

The main quality goals are:

* **Usability**: The interface should be intuitive, with clear instructions and an accessible design. This will allow users of all abilities to navigate and use the application effortlessly. It must mantain usability in mobile devices.
* **Availability**: The system should aim for maximum availability, ensuring it is accessible around the clock. This will guarantee uninterrupted access most of the time, regardless of their time zone or schedule.
* **Testability**: The code must be tested and should be easy to test (for instance with datatest-id to reference elements). The tests ease the implementation of new features because they make sure old functionality never stops working.
* **Performance**: Efficiency is a priority in system usage, particularly in quick question generation, ensuring a good experience for users.

.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Tree

image:10_quality_tree.PNG["Quality Tree"]

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

=== Quality Scenarios

Usage Scenario table:

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Usage Scenario|System Reaction
|The user initiates the web application, enters their username and password, and clicks the login button.|The system verifies the information entered by the user, and if correct, redirects them to the main page; otherwise, it indicates an error has occurred.
|The user surveys the main window, where several buttons with different options appear.|In response to pressing each of these buttons, the system will display the corresponding content.
|The user starts the game and is awaiting the questions.|The system swiftly generates the question and its possible answers.
|The user loses the game and decides to stop playing for a while. Five hours later, they decide to play again.|The system remains active and functions correctly.
|===


Change Scenario table:

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Change Scenario|System Reaction
|Adding an additional login system to access the account not only through username but also through the email. |The system should be capable of adapting to provide this functionality without affecting the existing ones. The tests verify that the old login is not affected.
|Adding a new game mode or functionality.|When adding a new feature, the application's usage methodology should not be distorted, ensuring it can still be used in the same manner.
|Adding a new game language.|When adding a new game language, the system should continue to function smoothly.

.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.
