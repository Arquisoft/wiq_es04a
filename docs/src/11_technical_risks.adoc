== Risks and Technical Debts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority

.Motivation
“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

.Form
List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-11/[Risks and Technical Debt] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Risks 
To assess the relevance level of the following risks, we will use number 1 to indicate low relevance, 2 for medium relevance, and 3 for high relevance.
[cols="1,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Risk | Relevance |  Considerations
| Limited knowledge of certain tools or languages | 2 | A solution could be to use the tools and languages that are most well-known to the team members. Also, each member should try to learn those aspects they know less about.
| The team has not worked together before | 1 | A suggestion could be to mantain a good communication and inform about any aspect that could affect others.
| Being a big group | 1 | Being  many members can difficult the communication. However, if the previous suggestions are followed there should not be any problem.

=== Technical debts 
[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Technical Debt |  Considerations
| Low-quality code | The use of new technologies and languages can lead to poorly written or poorly designed code. To address this issue, we will use pull requests to ensure that the code is reviewed by multiple team members.
| Deployment issues | Having not worked with Docker and other deployment tools before may cause problems when deploying the application. For this reason, we are trying to put our best into learning these new technologies.
| Dependency with Wikidata | It is a requirement so we need to depend on it. However, we have created a questions database so in case that Wikidata was not working, the application would continue to work for some time.
| Filtering questions and answers | Given the structure of Wikidata there are sometimes where questions and answers do not have the proper label we are looking for. Although we have stablished filters and different strategies, sometimes it fails.
| Changes in database model | Changing the model of a relational database makes it necessary to create a new database, losing all of the data we had before.
| Game duplication code | Due to our little knowledge about JavaScript, we have not found a way of optimizing code from different game modes. It would be necessary to search for another way of doing it, as this is not maintenable.
| Non-expiring session token | Once someone has logged in in the application, session token does not expire. That way session does not finish unless you explicitly log out.
